As an instructor of the IP Based Systems and Applications and Information Security courses, her knowledge and diligence outweighed any other students in her class and impressed me very much. I came to know her since September 2022 while teaching in her class. During the semesters hergrades were exceptionally good. During my course she worked hard and acquired cisco specific computer network knowledge. Silina recognized that practical knowledge is more important today than ever before, that’s why she had put in a large amount of extra effort on practice even after mandatory class hours.This student exhibits good characteristics, including confidence, inventiveness and excellent participation in teamwork, which are essential to be a valuable member of any organization.",
